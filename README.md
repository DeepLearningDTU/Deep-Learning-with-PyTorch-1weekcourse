# Deep learning one week course (with PyTorch)

This repository contains exercises for the [DTU continuing education course](https://www.dtu.dk/english/education/continuing-education/courses/computer-science/deep-learning). All exercises are written in the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language and formatted into [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). If you're unfamiliar with notebooks, it can be a good idea to familiarize yourself with them in advance.

This repository borrows heavily from previous works, in particular:

* [02456 Deep Learning](https://github.com/DeepLearningDTU/02456-deep-learning-with-PyTorch) - Fall course in Deep Learning for postgraduates.

* [2015 DTU Summerschool in Deep Learning](https://github.com/DeepLearningDTU/Summerschool_2015/tree/master/day1-NN). A PhD summerschool that was held at DTU in 2015. Exercises both in **numpy** and **Theano**.

* [02456-deep-learning](https://github.com/DeepLearningDTU/02456-deep-learning). Previous version of the course material for this course, but using **TensorFlow** for the exercises.

* [Pytorch Tutorial](https://github.com/munkai/pytorch-tutorial). A remix popular deep learning materials, including material from 02456, collected in one coherent package using **PyTorch**, with a focus on natural language processing (NLP)

* [pytorch/tutorials](https://github.com/pytorch/tutorials). Official tutorials from the PyTorch repo.

## Setup
The **recommended** (and by far the easiest) way to get started with the exercises is by using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb). It allows you to work with Jupyter Notebooks in the cloud with all dependencies pre-installed, and Colab offers GPU utility for free which allows you to run the exercises considerably faster.

You may also install Python locally using, e.g., using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download).
